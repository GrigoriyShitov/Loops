Part 1

Tasks on the use of for loop operators. Enter the necessary data, implement the algorithm using for loop operators, and output the results. It is not allowed to use other loop operators.

Tasks

Compulsory task*. Enter an integer N > 0. Find the square of this number using the following formula for its calculation: N2=1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2*N - 1). After adding each summand to the sum, output the current value of the sum (as a result, the squares of all integers from 1 to N will be output).
Part No. 2

Tasks on the use of loop operators with a postcondition. Enter the necessary data, implement the algorithm using do - while loop operators, and output the results. It is inadmissible to use other loop operators.

Tasks

Input a sequence of integers and compare what is greater, the number of positive or the number of negative integers. The sequence is potentially unlimited, the number 0 is the end of the sequence.

Part #3

Tasks on the use of loop operators with a precondition. Enter the necessary data, implement the algorithm using while loop operators, provide the output of the obtained results. Using other loop operators is inadmissible.

Tasks

Enter positive numbers A, B, C. On a rectangle of size A x B the maximum possible number of squares with side C (without overlapping) is placed. Find the number of squares placed on the rectangle. Do not use multiplication and division operations.
